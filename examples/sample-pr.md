## Title

`fix: Strip markdown code fences from LLM responses before JSON parsing [ENG-142]`

## Body

### Summary
Added markdown code fence stripping to the shared `parseAgentResponse` utility. LLM responses wrapped in ` ```json ... ``` ` are now handled gracefully before `JSON.parse()`.

### Root Cause
The LLM occasionally wraps JSON output in markdown code fences. The `parseAgentResponse` function in `src/utils/parse.ts` passed the raw response directly to `JSON.parse()`, which fails on the backtick characters.

### Files Changed
- `src/utils/parse.ts`

### Issue
[ENG-142](https://linear.app/your-org/issue/ENG-142)
